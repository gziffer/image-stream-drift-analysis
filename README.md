# Exploring Concept Drift Visualization and Explanation in Image Streams

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for the research paper **Exploring Concept Drift Visualization and Explanation in Image Streams**. Our work focuses on innovative approaches to visualize and explain drift in real-time image streams, an often overlooked area in the field of Machine Learning applied to data streams.

## Key Features

- Zero-shot classification using pre-trained ResNet-50 for drift visualization
- Integration of ResNet-50 with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) for drift identification
- Experiments conducted on the CLEAR10 dataset, a benchmark for natural temporal evolution of visual concepts

## Code Availability

**Note:** The code for this project will be uploaded soon. We are currently preparing and documenting the codebase to ensure it is clear and usable for the research community. Please check back in the near future for updates.
